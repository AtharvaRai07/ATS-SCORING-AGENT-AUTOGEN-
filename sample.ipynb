    "   - Retrieve corresponding industry benchmarks from memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Generate Visualizations using Python\n",
    "   - Bar Chart: Compare user scores vs. industry benchmarks for each category.\n",
    "   - Pie Chart: Show weighted score contributions of each category.\n",
    "   - Radar Chart: Show category performance distribution.\n",
    "   - I want them to be combined in a same png file with name \"combine_chart.png\".\n",
    "   - At last print something like this \"print(\"Charts generated\")\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Code Generation Requirements\n",
    "   - Write the Python code using matplotlib and seaborn.\n",
    "   - Include code to save the generated images in the same directory.\n",
    "   - Structure the code in a single code block.\n",
    "   - You have to write the code in the example format:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     code = '''\n",
    "         print(\"Hello World\")\n",

    "         print(\"Code saved successfully in solution.py\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Response Structure\n",
    "   - Step 1: Explain your plan to solve the task.\n",
    "   - Step 2: Provide the Python code inside a single code block.\n",
    "   - Step 3: After execution, send the code to visualizer agent make sure the code only have matplotlib, seaborn and numpy import.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important Notes:\n",
    "- Always ensure the charts accurately reflect user scores vs. industry benchmarks.\n",
    "- Ensure the pie chart correctly uses weighted contributions.\n",
    "- Radar chart axes must correspond to each scoring category.\n",
    "- Do not split code into multiple blocks.\n",
    "- Follow the template strictly for saving the code.\"\"\"\n",

    "1. Compare the resume to each job description using the following categories:\n",

    "   - Education Alignment: 15%\n",

side‑by‑side comparison of your ATS‑derived scores against the most relevant industry benchmarks (drawn from our memory database).  \\nThe comparison uses **Tech**‑industry standards where available, otherwise **Engineering** standards, which are most applicable to software‑engineering resumes.\\n\\n| Category | Your Score | Benchmark (Tech/Eng) | Δ (Your\\u202f–\\u202fBenchmark) | Interpretation |\\n|---------|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------|\\n| **Skills Match** | 61\\u202f% | 85\\u202f% (Tech) | **‑24\\u202f%** | Well below the industry norm for tech‑engineers. |\\n| **Experience Relevance** | 90\\u202f% | 90\\u202f% (Tech) | **0\\u202f%** | Meets the benchmark exactly. |\\n| **Education Alignment** | 100\\u202f% | 92\\u202f% (Eng) | **+8\\u202f%** | Exceeds the benchmark; no education mismatch. |\\n| **Keyword Optimization** | 61\\u202f% | 78\\u202f% (Engineering) | **‑17\\u202f%** | Short on the expected keyword density. |\\n| **Format & Structure** | 85\\u202f% | – | – | No industry benchmark available; 85\\u202f% is solid. |\\n\\n### Key Take‑aways\\n\\n| Category | What the number means | Actionable Advice |\\n|---------|---------------------|------------------|\\n| **Skills Match** | Only 61\\u202f% of the job‑specific keywords appear in your resume. | • List all relevant languages & frameworks (e.g., **Spring Boot, PostgreSQL** for healthcare roles).<br>• Highlight tech‑stack usage in each role (e.g., “Implemented microservices with Spring Boot, PostgreSQL”). |\\n| **Experience Relevance** | You’re perfectly matched in terms of years & role seniority. | • Keep this section concise and focused on achievements. |\\n| **Education Alignment** | Over‑aligned—your B.Tech matches or exceeds the requirement. | • No change needed. |\\n| **Keyword Optimization** | Your résumé’s keyword density is 17\\u202f% below benchmark. | • Re‑scan each job description and add missing terms (e.g., **CI/CD, Terraform, GitHub Actions**).<br>• Use the exact phrasing from the job ad (e.g., “Java\\u202fRuntimes” vs “Java”). |\\n| **Format & Structure** | 85\\u202f% indicates a clean, readable resume. | • Minor tweaks (e.g., bullet‑point consistency, avoid passive voice). |\\n\\n### Confidence Interval\\nYour overall confidence interval (+/-\\u202f10\\u202f%) reflects the variability of ATS scoring; the true score could range **68–88\\u202f%**. Improving the lower‑scoring categories (skills match & keyword optimization) will shift this range upward.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Quick Fix Checklist\\n\\n| Item | What to add/modify | Why it matters |\\n|------|-------------------|---------------|\\n| **Add missing tech keywords** | Insert “Spring Boot”, “PostgreSQL”, “CI/CD”, “Terraform” | Aligns with job‑specific language |\\n| **Quantify impact** | e.g., “Reduced deployment time 30\\u202f% using AWS CloudFormation” | Increases relevance perception |\\n| **Highlight certifications** | Emphasize AWS Certified Developer next to AWS skill | Boosts keyword density |\\n| **Revise summary** | Use “Java, Spring Boot, AWS, PostgreSQL” explicitly | Directly matches key terms |\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Bottom line:**  \\nYou already score strongly on **experience relevance** and **education alignment**, but there's room to improve **skills match** and **keyword optimization**—the two biggest contributors to the overall score. Adjusting these sections will raise your ATS score and bring it in line with industry benchmarks, boosting your chances of landing a senior‑level engineering role.\", type='TextMessage'), TextMessage(id='3118cab5-b8d2-4780-a1cf-5298b0c05f60', source='Visualizer_Agent', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=3241, completion_tokens=1275), metadata={}, created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 8, 14, 11, 40, 51, 868781, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), content='```python\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nimport seaborn as sns\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------\\n# 1.

ATS score is **78\\u202f/\\u202f100**, which is considered a **Good Fit** for the roles you’re targeting.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Strengths\\n- **Experience Relevance – 90\\u202f%**  \\n  Your 7\\u202fyears of software engineering, including senior roles, align perfectly with the senior‑level expectations in the job ads.\\n- **Education Alignment – 100\\u202f%**  \\n  A B.Tech in Computer Science meets or exceeds all educational requirements (most postings don’t specify a degree).\\n- **Format & Structure – 85\\u202f%**  \\n  Your resume is clean, with clear sections and ATS‑friendly layout, making it easy for recruiters to scan.\\n- **Certification – AWS Certified Developer**  \\n  Adds credibility for cloud‑based positions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Areas for Improvement\\n| Category | Score | What it Means | Missing Keywords |\\n|---------|------|--------------|-----------------|\\n| **Skills Match – 61\\u202f%** | You’re covering core tech, but only a little over half of the job‑specific terms are present. | Add the exact terms employers are searching for. | **Java, Spring\\u202fBoot, PostgreSQL, CI/CD, Terraform, GitHub Actions, Java\\u202fRuntimes, Java\\u202fEcosystem, Cloud‑Native** |\\n| **Keyword Optimization – 61\\u202f%** | The density of target keywords is lower than industry benchmarks. | Sprinkle these keywords naturally into your bullet points and summary. | Same list as above plus **Docker, Kubernetes, AWS CloudFormation, Git** |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n1. **Revise your summary**  \\n   • Highlight the most sought‑after stacks:  \\n   `“Senior Software Engineer with 7\\u202fyrs of experience in Java, Spring\\u202fBoot, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes.”`\\n2. **Add missing keywords to your experience bullets**  \\n   *Example:*  \\n   `“Designed and deployed micro‑services with Spring\\u202fBoot and PostgreSQL, reducing data‑access latency by 30\\u202f%.”`  \\n   *Example:*  \\n   `“Automated CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, Terraform, and AWS CloudFormation.”`\\n3. **Include a dedicated Skills section**  \\n   List all relevant technologies and tools, using the exact terminology from the ads (e.g., “Java\\u202fRuntimes,” “Spring Boot,” “PostgreSQL,” “CI/CD”).  \\n4. **Quantify impact** wherever possible (e.g., “Cut deployment time from 45\\u202fmin to 12\\u202fmin using Docker & Kubernetes”).  \\n5. **Update certifications section** to show AWS‑related expertise prominently next to the skill name.  \\n6. **Run a quick keyword check** against each job description (or use an online ATS checker) to ensure you hit all the high‑value terms.  \\n7. **Proofread for consistency** – keep bullet‑point style uniform, avoid passive voice, and ensure all dates are in the same format.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWith these targeted adjustments, you can raise your ATS score by roughly **10–15\\u202fpoints**, moving you solidly into the **Excellent Fit** range and boosting your chances of landing an interview for senior‑level roles.
